## demo_zsl_domain_division

Domain division for ZSL in matlab. We extend W-SVM for open-set learning to zero-shot learning setting.

This demo contains the domain division step for AWA dataset. Notably, "awa_tr_res_v2.mat", "awa_seen_res_v2.mat", "awa_unseen_res_v2.mat" are predicted by W-SVM algorithm. 

You have to download the feature map (ResNet-101) before running the code. (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r4oGa41yLtVxdwEAPewvVlQP3nCzi-kh)
